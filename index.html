                <p>Firstly, it is essential to understand the concept of cloud storage and its evolution over time. Cloud storage is a data storage model that utilizes logical pools, allowing users to access and update their data through web browsers or apps on various platforms such as Android, iOS, Linux, macOS, and Windows.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Cloud computing is not a new concept, and its origins can be traced back to the 1960s when J.C.R Licklider invented it for ARPANET. In 1983, the first commercial cloud storage services were introduced by CompuServe TM (now owned by Verizon Media TM), and today there are countless cloud providers, including Amazon, Google Cloud, SmugMug, Dropbox, iCloud from Apple, OneDrive from Microsoft, Pinterest, Box, among others.</p>
                <br><br>
                <p>But why is cloud storage necessary?</p>
                <br><br>
                <p>- It allows users to automatically sync their files across multiple devices.</p>
                <br><br>
                <p>- Users can easily share files with others using clouds.</p>
                <br><br>
                <p>- Users can create backups of their personal data.</p>
                <br><br>
                <p>- It protects users' work from accidental destruction.</p>
                <br><br><br>
                <p>- It also extends the storage capacity of devices with limited storage.</p>

                <p>To install OwnCloud, you need a server to host it. This server can be an old computer or a virtual machine, with Oracle VirtualBox being a good option for hosting it. Using VirtualBox allows you to add additional virtual processors, video card, and storage space that the physical PC may not have, making it easier to host OwnCloud. It also allows for easy backup and restore of all data files.</p>
                <br>
                <p>To install OwnCloud, you can download it from the website and choose VirtualBox as the option for running a virtual machine. The program takes up about 1.9 GB of space on the computer.</p>
